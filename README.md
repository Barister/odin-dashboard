This Admin Dashboard project is an implementation of a homework assignment from the Intermediate HTML and CSS block of The Odin Project course. 
I attempted to modify the assignment's theme to suit the Guesthouses vacation rental business project's administration. 
Many thanks to the authors, the design was largely inspired by Tekki Web Solutions Pvt. Ltd.'s solution, found at https://dribbble.com/shots/5082294-Property-Management-Dashboard-Design. 
I hope they don't mind.

Please note that all data presented in the charts are fictional and do not represent real-world information.

The project primarily uses grid layout, as per the course curriculum, along with occasional flexbox usage. 
One of the charts is created using pure CSS, while the other utilizes Chart.JS. Additionally, Font Awesome icons are integrated.

I have made efforts to ensure the page is fully responsive for mobile devices with the knowledge I possess as of today.
